This repo has two files. one is jupyter notebook and another on .py. if you just want to run the code then try .py.
from your command prompt or just write python or python3 then the filename.py. if you want to play with the code try the jupyter
notebook one.  



What does the code do:
1. it first takes inputs about the machine user want to connect. then connect to that machine via ssh. after successfull connection
user can give command to the remote machine. if the command produces any output it will be saved in a txt file. txt files names are
given according to time. so that it can be easier to find in the future
